# Sales Forecasting with Time-Series (R) - WISP Ice-Cream 

## Executive Summary:
This project showcases a sophisticated and data-driven analytical approach to accurately forecast sales for "Wisp", a low-calorie ice-cream product, through the application of rigorous quantitative methodologies. The core objective was to derive predictive insights from exntensive historical sales data and comprehensively analyse the nuanced impact of various marketing interventions. The meticulously designed methodology encompassed a multi-stage pipeline: robust data preprocessing to ensure analytical readiness, the strategic application of multiple linear regression to precisely quantify marketing effectiveness, and advanced time-series analysis leveraging ARIMA modelling to generate highly reliable sales forecasts. This comprehensive body of work provides critical, actionable intelligence essential for informed strategic business planning, optimised resource allocation, and enhanced operational efficiency within the competitve ice-cream market. 

## Problem Statement:
The primary business imperative was to establish a precise understanding of the sales dynamics inherent to "Wisp", a new low-calorie ice-cream product. This understanding would then serve as the foundation for leveraging historical sales and associated marketing data to generate reliable sales predictions for the immediate upcoming month. This initiative was strategically aligned with addressing the burgeoning demand within the UK ice-cream industry, a trend significatly influenced by evolving climatic conditions leading to warmer periods and a pronounced shift in consumer preferences towards healthier alternatives, particularly among the discerning millenial demogrpahic. The overachieving goal of the analysis was to accurately uncover the intricate relationship between specific marketing activities and corresponding sales outcomes, thereby delivering precise sales forecasts crucial for optimising inventory management, strategically allocating marketing budgets, and driving overall growth initiatives. 

## Data Sources and Confidentiality:
The analytical foundation of this project was built upon a precisely collected, proprietary dataset. This dataset provided granular historical sales figures for the "Wisp" ice-cream product, distributed across various geographical regions. Complementary data points included detailed information on distinct marketing activities, categorised as AD1, AD2, and Promotion. These attributes offered a comprehensive temporal view of sales performance in conjunction with excluded promotional efforts. 

**Given the academic context of this project and the inherently proprietary nature of the sales data provided, the original dataset is strictly confidential and cannot be publicly shared within this repository. Moreover, the entirety of the project's analytical code, developed in the R programming language, is also withheld from public access to uphold confidentiality agreements and protect intellectual property**.

## Methodology:
A comprehensive, systematic, and highly quantitative methodology pipeline was thoroughly implemented throughout this project, encompassing several critical and interlined stages designed to maximise data utility and model predictive power:
1. **Data Pre-processing and Transformation**:
   * **Data Integrity Assessment**: Initial, rigorous data integrity checks were performed to identify and rectify anomalies. This critical phase involved the precise identification and subsequent removal of any missing values or duplicate records, a fundamental step to ensure the highest quality and reliability of the dataset for subsequent analytical procedures.
   * **Logarithmic Transformation for Sales**: Sales figures withing the dataset exhibited considerable variability and often a skewed distribution. To address this, sales data underwent a **logarithmic transformation**. This crucial preprocessing step served multiple purposes: it stablised the variance across different scales, normalised the distribution of sales data (making it more conformant to assumptions of linear models), and notably improved the linearity of relationships between sales and other variables. This transformation is pivotal for ensuring the robustness and validity of statistical models, particularly linear regression.
   * **Variable Structuring**: The prepard dataset was meticulously structured to clearly delineate independent variables (AD1, AD2, and Promotion, representing distinct marketing channels or campaigns) from the dependent variable (Sales), establishing the foundational framework for regression and forecasting models.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression Analysis**:
   * **Impact Quantification**: A robust **multiple linear regression model** was constructed. This model was designed to carefully quantify both the individual and collective impact of each marketing activity on sales, alongside assessing their statistical significance.
   * **Coefficient and Correlation Insights**: The model yielded precise regression coefficients, which denote the change in sales for a one-unit change in each marketing variable, holding others constant. Additionally, correlation values provided a clear understanding of the direction and strength of the linear relationship between marketing spend and sales performance. This comprehensive output facilitated a precise assessment of marketing effectiveness, allowing for insights into marketing elasticity and optimal resource allocation. The diagnistic plots (discussed below) were crucial in validating the underlying assumptions of this model, such as linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.

3. **Advanced Time-Series Analysis and Forecasting (ARIMA Modelling)**:
   * **Time-Series Characterisation**: Comprehensive time-series analyses were conducted individually for sales data across all five distinct geographical regions, recognising that sales patterns can vary significantly by location.
   * **Stationarity Testing (ADF)**: The **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test** was systematically applied to each time series to accurately assess its stationarity. Stationarity, characterised by a constant mean, varaince, and autocorrelation over time, is a critical prerequisite for many time-series models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. Consistently observed p-values greater than 0.05 from the ADF test unequivocally indicated the non-stationary nature of the initial sales series.
   * **Differencing for Stationarity**: To achieve the necessary stationarity, **differencing** of the time series was iteratively applied. This process involves calculating the difference between consecutive observations (first-order differencing), and potentially higher orders, to remove trends and seasonality. This transformation renders the series stationary, making it suitable for ARIMA modelling.
   * **ACF and PACF for Model Order Identification**: Following differencing, **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots** were generated and analysed. These plots are indispensable in identifying the optimal orders for the ARIMA model: the **Auto-Regressive (AR) Model Order (p)**, the **Integrated (I) Order (d)** (determined by the number of differencing operations), and the **Moving Average (MA) Order (q)**. The patterns of spikes and tails in these plots directly informed the selection of these critical parameters, ensuring a parsimonious and effective model.
   * **Rigorous Model Validation (80:20 Split)**: For robust model validation and to prevent overfitting, the prepared dataset was partitioned into an **80:20 training-testing split**. Crucially, the most recent segment of the data was explicitly reserved for the testing set, mimicking real-world forecasting scenarios. The training set was utilised to fit and calibrate the chosen ARIMA model, and its predictive performance was subsequently evaluated on the unseen test set.
   * **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) Assessment**: **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** was computed during the validation phase. MAPE offers a highly intuitive and interpretable metric of forecast accuracy, expressing errors as a percentage of actual values, which is particularly valuable for business stakeholders to understand the magnitude of forecasting deviation.
   * **Future Sales Prediction**: Leveraging all available historical sales data and the optimised ARIMA model parameters (p,d,q), the final fitted models were then used to generate precise **predicted sales values for the immediate upcoming month** for each individual region, providing forward-looking operational guidance.
  
## Key Findings and Impact:
This project delivered profound, data-backed insights into the Wisp ice-cream sales landscape, establishing a robust analytical framework critical for strategic decision-making and operational excellence:
* **Quantified Marketing Efficacy and ROI Optimisation**: The in-depth analysis definitively demonstrated the varying efficacy and return on investment (ROI) across different marketing channels. TV Ads consistently generated the highest average sales volumes, and crucially, were found to be notably more cost-effective per unit of sales generated compared to Banners. This finding provides a clear, data-driven directive for optimising marketing budget allocation, enabling more impactful and efficient promotional strategies.
* **Robust Model Performance and Assumption Validation**: The multiple linear regression model exhibited exceptional predictive power and reliability, evidenced by an impressive **adjusted R-squared value of 0.9713**. This indicates that approximately 97.13% of the variance in sales could be explained by the marketing variables, signifying a strong model fit. A remarkably low **Residual Standard Error (RSE) of 6.2%** further underscored the model's acciracy, representing a minimal average forecasting error for the linear components. Comprehensive **diagnostic plots** (Residuals vs Fitted, Scale-Location, Normal Q-Q, and Residuals vs Leverage) were instrumental in validating the underlying assumptions of the linear model, confirming linearity, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), normality of residuals, and the absence of influential outliers, thus ensuring the model's statistical validity.
* **Unveiled Sales Patterns and Seasonal Dynamics**: Analysis revealed that consumption patterns for Wisp were predominantly concentrated within the Capital, East, and South regions, a distribution likely correlating with higher densities of the target millenial demographic in these urban and suburban areas. Sales exhibited clear and pronounced **seasonal variation**, with significant peaks consistently observed during warmer months, aligning perfectly with typical ice cream consumption trends. The analysis also captured specific regional sales dynamics over a three-year period, providing nuanced insights into how localised competitive landscapes and evolving market awareness influenced sales performance differently across geographies.
* **Actionable Sales Predictions for Operational Planning**: The time-series models yielded precise and region-specific predicted sales figures for the immediate upcoming month. These quantitative forecasts provide a concrete and reliable basis for critical operational activities such as optimising inventory levels, streamlining distribution logistics, planning targeted promotional campaigns, and making proactive strategic business decisions.
* **Ackowledged Limitations and Future Research**: The robustness of the developed models is transparently tempered by certain inherent data limitations. These include the comparatively small dataset size (only thirty-six sales values per region), which, coupled with high within-region variability, posed risks of model overfitting and could potentially limit the generalisability of some findings. Furthermore, the inherent structure if Auto-Regressive models restricts their ability to incorporate or predict the impact of external, unforeseen macroeconomic or societal factors (e.g.m global pandemics, significant regulatory shifts, sudden competitor actions) into the forecasts. The presence of specific outliers also presented challenges to predictive accuracy. These limitations are transparently ackownledged, not as weaknesses, but as crucial insights that guide avenues for future data collection, model refinement, and the potential integration of more complex exogenous variables for enhanced predictive accuracy.

## Tools and Technologies:
* **Programming Language**: R
* **Key Libraries and Techniques**:
  * **Data Manipulation and Preprocessing**: Utilised core R functionalities and potentially specialised packages for efficient data cleaning (e.g., identification and handling of missing values and duplicate records), and sophisticated transformations (e.g., 'log()' function for robust logarithmic transformation to stabilise variance and normalise distributions).
  * **Statistical Modelling**: Implementation of Multiple Linear Regression (primarily via R's powerful 'lm()' function) for comprehensive analysis of variable relationships and predictive modelling.
  * **Time Series Analysis**: Leveraged robust R packages specifically designed for time series. This included functionalities for stationarity testing (e.g.m 'adf.test()' from the 'tseries' package), effective differencing techniques, and advanced ARIMA model fitting (e.g., 'auto_arima()' from the 'forecast' package for automated model selection, or 'arima()' from base R for manual specification).
  * **Visualisation**: Extensively used 'ggplot2' , a highly regarded R package for generating high-quality, customisable statistical graphics. This enabled the creation of insightful visualisations such as sales trends over time, correlation plots, and essential model diagnostic plots (e.g., residual plots, Q-Q plots) that visually confirmed model assumptions.
